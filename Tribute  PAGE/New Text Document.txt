       <h3>Ratan Tata Is Called A Gem Of India! </h3>
       <p>
        Ratan Tata is not just Tata’s chairman but a well-versed patriot who has not
        just helped his company grow but also laid the foundation for the group to
        compete at the global level. Ratan Tata’s Tata Group has taken India on the
         global map as an economic force to be reckoned with and has helped India
        survive some of its most challenging times. Let’s look at a few things that 
        prove why he is the Gem.

    <p>
        "   " Ratan Tata never allows the mistreatment of men and women. He is known to be
         easily accessible and communicate with workers and who’s who of power list
          with the same dignity and love. There have been many such instances and experiences 
          of Ratan Tata treating every individual with a great amount of respect at any given 
          place and time. Remember the 26/11 attacks, here is what Ratan Tata did for the 
          employees after the attack at the Taj Hotel
